# Session 0: Getting Set up (Pre-Work)

In the videos you learned:
- Expressions and Statements
- Integers, floats and strings
- Variables

Lets just play with these a bit to make sure everythin is working.

## A little theory
Which of the following are operators, and which are values?

```py
*
'hello'
-88.8
-
/
+
5
```

Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?

```py
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
```

## To print something to the screen



## Computers love arithmetic
Write a script that prompts the user for two numbers, multiplies the numbers together and prints the result to the console.

```py
# To prompt the user to enter a value
my_string = input("Message to the user")
```

## Division
What is 17 divided by 3?
How many times does 3 divide into 17?
