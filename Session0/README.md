# Session 0: Getting Set up (Pre-Work)

This session is intended to be completed before attending the first face-to-face session and covers installing python, setting up an interactive development environment and solving a few simple problems.

Follow this guide to get setup. It is not a difficult process but follow the instructions carefully. This way everyone is configured the same way.

## Step 1: Introduction to Automate the Boring Stuff

A great teacher, Al Sweigart, created an open source beginners guide to python programming called [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). It is a great resource with an online text book and youtube videos. Since it aligns so closely to our course and goals that we will rely on it throughout the course.

Please watch this [short video](https://youtu.be/1F_OgqRuSdI) to get started. Ignore the download instructions, we will get to that.

## Step 2: Install Python

You may have heard us say python is a programming language. So why do we need to install anything? We need to install the 'interpreter' that understands our python code and tells the computer what to do. That is the first step.

We have downloaded python from the python website for you and placed it on the Arup network drive. This way we can minimise our number of downloads from Rackspace - the genorous company that hosts python for everyone... for free!

1. Copy the `python-3.6.1-amd64.exe` file from the Arup Programs folder (P:\Program Files\Python) to your desktop.
2. Double click the file.
3. Select `Run` if a security warning appears.
4. Tick the box `Add Python 3.6 to PATH` and then select `Install Now`.

5. If everything goes well a success message will appear. Select `Close`.

6. Go to your start menu and look for `IDLE (Python 3.6 64-bit)`. Once selected the python command prompt should appear.

Please get in touch if you get stuck.

## Step 3: Install Visual Studio Code

In the videos you have been watching from Automate the Boring Stuff, Al uses a text editor called IDLE that comes standard with python. You can use this if you want. However, we suggests using a more advanced editor called Visual Studio Code (we use it on a daily basis). Follow these instructions to install it on your computer.

1. Copy the `VSCodeSetup-1.11.2.exe` file from the Arup Programs folder (P:\Program Files\Visual Studio Code) to your desktop.
2. Double click the file and follow the instructions in this [video](https://youtu.be/8tkuu0Rugg4?t=1m34s).

## Step 4: Your First Problem Set

In each session we will provide a README.md (this file), a problem set and solutions. As part of this pre work, watch the [next video](https://youtu.be/7qHMXu99d88) from automate the boring stuff and try to solve problems in the file __session_0_problems.md__.

Use slack to ask questions if you get stuck.

See you in the first session!
