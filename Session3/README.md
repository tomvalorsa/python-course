# Session 3: Python Data Types

The primitive types are:
1. Booleans are either True or False. 
2. Numbers can be integers (1 and 2), floats (1.1 and 1.2), fractions (1/2 and 2/3), or even complex numbers. 
3. Strings are sequences of Unicode characters, e.g. an HTML document. 
4. Bytes and byte arrays, e.g. a JPEG image file. 
5. Lists are ordered sequences of values. 
6. Tuples are ordered, immutable sequences of values. 
7. Sets are unordered bags of values. 
8. Dictionaries are unordered bags of key-value pairs. 

We covered Booleans, Numbers and Strings sessions 0 and 1. This session we will cover Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries.

[Dive in Python 3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/native-datatypes.html) is a useful resource on these.
