## What this course covers

This course has been broken up into a series of sessions that introduce the concepts involved in computer programming using the python programming language. Each sesson includes a mini lecture and a problem set. It is intended that you attend a session every fortnight.

The course is intended to be worked through in a group. Please join a group and create a [slack](www.slack.com/auâ€Ž) channel for your group (invite your tutor). Sessions 5, 7 & 8 are dedicated for group projects.

## What you can expect to gain from this course

Having completed the sessions you should be able to:

- Write simple programs that will enable you to do daily tasks more effectively
- Identify opportunities where programming may offer a better outcome than current practice 
- Understand software development practices and work as a team on problems
- Evaluate the merit of developing applications (complexity, 3rd party alternatives etc.)

## Is this course for you

This course is for everyone! Absolutely no background required. However, think of learning programming as learning a language. It takes time to become fluent and hard work is the only way to get there.

## Getting Started

Head over to the session 0 folder. It contains installation instructions, pre-reading and a warm-up problem set. You MUST complete this before attending the first session.

## Where to get help

If in doubt, ASK! There is a slack channel that has been created for this course. Post any question you have there and one of the tutor or a fellow student will answer your question.
